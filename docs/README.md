## üì° API Basics

All Times Gate commands use HTTP POST requests to `http://{device_ip}:80/post` with JSON payloads:

```json
{
    "Command": "Channel/SetBrightness",
    "Brightness": 75
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Examples

### Set Brightness
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.68.50:80/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Command":"Channel/SetBrightness","Brightness":75}'
```

### Display Text
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.68.50:80/post \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Command":"Draw/SendHttpText","TextId":1,"x":0,"y":0,"dir":0,"font":2,"TextWidth":64,"TextString":"Hello World","speed":100,"color":"#FF0000"}'
```
